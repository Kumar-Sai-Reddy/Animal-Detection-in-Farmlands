Abstract:
Crop loss caused by animal assaults is one of the most concerned problem and serious hazards to crop productivity. Crop raiding has become serious antago nistic human-animal conflicts as cultivated land has expanded into prior wildlife habitat. Farmers in India confront major risks from pests, natural disasters, and animal damage, all of which result in poorer yields. Farmers’ traditional tactics are ineffective, and it is not viable to pay guards to keep an eye on crops and prevent wild animals.it is critical to safeguard crops from animal damage while also diverting the animal without causing injury. To overcome this problem faced by the farmers, we are proposing a detection system for intrusion of animals into the agricultural field where animal images are segmented to extract different objects in the image captured through a camera and see if the segmentation detects any threatening animals. we proposed a methos to detect animals using yolo which is an object detection algorithm used to detect objects. In this project yolo v8 is used which is the latest version of yolo to detect animals.
